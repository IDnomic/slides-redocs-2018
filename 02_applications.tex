\section[Blockchains for PKI]{How blockchains could enhance PKI}

\begin{frame}{PKI}
	\begin{alertblock}{Issues}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item No way to know if CA is corrupted
			\item CA producing certificates for domains they don't own (Iran with Google)
			\item some web browsers don't check for certification revocation
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Blockchain}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item adds another channel to check for certificate validity
			\item \textbf{transparency} and \textbf{traceability}
			\item Secure distributed log that cannot be altered
			\item The whole chain of trust is stored
			\item revocation lists are all stored in the same place
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Applications}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Web browsing}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Privacy and confidentiality issue: are visited websites what they pretend to be?
			\item Millions of certificates, with variable lifetime
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
	
	\begin{alertblock}{Connected cars}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Safety issue: connected or even autonomous cars might need to check that the surrounding cars are legitimate
			\item Thousands of certificates, with a one-week lifetime
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}

%\emph{In both cases, all certificates and CRLs would be stocked together in a blockchain.}
