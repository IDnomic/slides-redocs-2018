\section[Blockchains for PKI]{How blockchains could enhancing PKI}

\begin{frame}{Blockchain and Man-in-the-middle attacks}
	\begin{alertblock}{Attacks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Hack of genuine certification authorities
			\item CA producing certificates for domains they don't own (Iran with Google)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Blockchain}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \mg{transparency} and \mg{traceability}
			\item Secure distributed log that cannot be altered
			\item The whole chain of trust is stored
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Blockchain and Certificate Revocation Lists}
	\begin{alertblock}{Current issues}
		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Updated periodically but not instantly
			\item Separated process to check CRLs for end users: adds delays, and is not performed at all by some web browsers
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Blockchain solution}
%		\mg{Faster} and \mg{more secure} verification of revocations
		\begin{itemize}
%			\item CRLs are updated instantaneously
			\item All CRLs stored at the same place
			\item CRLs checked together with certificates in one single query
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples of applications of blockchains to PKIs}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Trusted domain names}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Privacy and confidentiality issue: are visited websites what they pretend to be ?
			\item Millions of certificates, with variable lifetime
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
	
	\begin{alertblock}{Trusted connected cars}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Safety issue: connected or even autonomous cars might need to check that the surrounding cars are legitimate
			\item Thousands of certificates, with a one-week lifetime
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}

%\emph{In both cases, all certificates and CRLs would be stocked together in a blockchain.}
