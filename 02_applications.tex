\emph{Attacks on certificate authorities are a major threat for PKIs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Man-in-the-middle \emph{(MITM)} attacks
\begin{itemize}
\item Some have been performed by states (Iran, China) or intelligence agencies (NSA)
\end{itemize}
\item Genuine certificates authorities have been hacked
\begin{itemize}
\item False certificates were issued
\end{itemize}
\item Revoked certificates constitute a weakness
\begin{itemize}
\item Certificate revocation lists \emph{(CRLs)} are updated periodically, but not instantly when certificates are proved to be forged
\item Checking the Certificate revocation lists \emph{(CRLs)} is a separate process that adds more queries and delays
\item This process is not performed at all by some web browsers
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\emph{Blockchain has many advantages for PKIs}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Security} with more \textbf{transparency} and \textbf{traceability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Blockchain is a secure distributed log that cannot be altered
\item The whole chain of trust is stored in the blockchain
\item MITM attacks are prevented
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Faster} and \textbf{more secure} verification of revocations
\begin{itemize}
\item CRLs are updated instantaneously in the blockchain
\item All CRLs for all CAs are stored at the same place
\item One query to check both certificates and the CRL, which is always performed
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\emph{Use cases examples}


\begin{itemize}
\item Trusted domain names
\begin{itemize}
\item Privacy and confidentiality issue: are visited websites what they pretend to be?
\end{itemize}
\item Trusted connected cars
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety issue: connected or even autonomous cars might need to check that the surrounding cars are legitimate
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{In both cases, all certificates and CRLs would be stocked together in a blockchain.}
