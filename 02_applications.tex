\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Man-in-the-middle \emph{(MITM)} attacks
\begin{itemize}
\item False certificate authorities
\item Hack of genuine certificates authorities
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm}
\item Blockchain: \mg{transparency} and \mg{traceability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure distributed log that cannot be altered
\item The whole chain of trust is stored
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Issues with certificate revocation lists \emph{(CRLs)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated periodically but not instantly
\item Separate process to check CRLs for end users: adds delays, and is not performed at all by some web browsers
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm}
\item Blockchain: \mg{Faster} and \mg{more secure} verification of revocations
\begin{itemize}
\item CRLs are updated instantaneously
\item All CRLs stored at the same place
\item CRLs checked together with certificates in one single query
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solution: new blockchain which stores all certificates and CRLs
\item Blockchain ledger available to everyone: single access point
\item Permissions: only authorized miners can add blocks
\item ...

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Man-in-the-middle \emph{(MITM)} attacks with false certificate authorities
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item Some have been performed by states (Iran, China) or intelligence agencies (NSA)
%%\end{itemize}
%\item Hack of genuine certificates authorities
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item False certificates were issued
%%\end{itemize}
%\item Revoked certificates constitute a weakness
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Certificate revocation lists \emph{(CRLs)} are updated periodically, but not instantly when certificates are proved to be forged
%\item Checking the Certificate revocation lists \emph{(CRLs)} is a separate process that adds more queries and delays
%\item This process is not performed at all by some web browsers
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

%\begin{frame}
%\emph{Blockchain has many advantages for PKIs}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \mg{Security} with more \mg{transparency} and \mg{traceability}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Blockchain is a secure distributed log that cannot be altered
%\item The whole chain of trust is stored in the blockchain
%\item MITM attacks are prevented
%\end{itemize}
%\item \mg{Faster} and \mg{more secure} verification of revocations
%\begin{itemize}
%\item CRLs are updated instantaneously in the blockchain
%\item All CRLs for all CAs are stored at the same place
%\item One query to check both certificates and the CRL, which is always performed
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\emph{Use cases examples - better after background on PKIs ?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Trusted domain names
\begin{itemize}
\item Privacy and confidentiality issue: are visited websites what they pretend to be ?
\item Millions of certificates, with variable lifetime
\end{itemize}
\item Trusted connected cars
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety issue: connected or even autonomous cars might need to check that the surrounding cars are legitimate
\item Thousands of certificates, with a one-week lifetime
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%\emph{In both cases, all certificates and CRLs would be stocked together in a blockchain.}
